                            He was of great help and took responsibility to ensure that the work went smooth and reached a high quality during the several weeks of the collaboration. 
                            He was attentive to our needs and wishes and made sure that the group collaborated to produce a clear and in-depth material of test data for our game project. 
                            <br><br>
                            The work consisted of finding test-participants and also to produce interview-questions and compile the results from these test-participants' testing of the game we're developing. 
                            Subsequently an analysis and conclusions were made that were insightful and the result was presented in a well-made presentation. 
                            Fabian shows that he takes the task seriously and shows that a passion exists for QA and to reach very good results."</i>

                        <p><i>"I have worked with Fabian on projects during our Bachelor’s in Software Engineering as well as on a project in Unity since March 2021. 
                            I find that little fazes Fabian - when approaching a complex problem, he calmly tries to understand the problem, then forms a plan to solve it and executes it effectively. 
                            His eagerness to learn, enthusiasm and dedication to his craft can be seen when he continually tries to improve the code architecture, grasp new concepts, and learn new tools quickly.
                            <br><br>
                            Fabian can always be relied on to work independently, delivering quality work. 
                            He is often proactive, unafraid to bring up issues or his thoughts when he believes it is necessary. 
                            During our academic projects, his strong work ethic was also shown when put under pressure, completing his tasks within tight deadlines.
                            <br><br>
                            Fabian’s sense of maturity is not only shown when dealing with technical issues, but also with his tact and consideration in human relationships. 
                            This has not only contributed to a sense of safety and fun in a work atmosphere, but also a voice of insight and reason as a friend. 
                            I believe Fabian can be a core asset to any team he wishes to be part of. As such, I can confidently recommend him."</i>
