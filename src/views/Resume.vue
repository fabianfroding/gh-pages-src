                        <p><i>"I can warmly recommend Fabian for different tasks in QA. 
                            He was of great help and took responsibility to ensure that the work went smooth and reached a high quality during the several weeks of the collaboration. 
                            He was attentive to our needs and wishes and made sure that the group collaborated to produce a clear and in-depth material of test data for our game project. 
                            The work consisted of finding test-participants and also to produce interview-questions and compile the results from these test-participants' testing of the game we're developing. 
                            Subsequently an analysis and conclusions were made that were insightful and the result was presented in a well-made presentation. 
                            Fabian shows that he takes the task seriously and shows that a passion exists for QA and to reach very good results."</i>
