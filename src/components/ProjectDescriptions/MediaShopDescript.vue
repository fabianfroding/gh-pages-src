            The project consists of three programs; the media shop, the integrator, and an external shop program.
            <br><br>
            Two user types exists, admin and user. The admin can add, remove and edit products, while the user can purchase and refund products.
            <br><br>
            The media shop serves as a product registry system. 
            The integrator can run in the background and allows the user to select input and output directories to handle changes.
            <br><br>
            The user can then simply choose to import and export the registries from the media shop and external shop system while the integrator runs in the background,
            handling the conversion automatically by watching changes in the selected directories.
            <br><br>
            The project was developed to practice learning new frameworks and technologies, 
            and uses an MVC-architecture.
