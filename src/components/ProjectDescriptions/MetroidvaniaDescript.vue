            This project is a metroidvania featuring a three-day cycle system inspired by the same system as in The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>The project is a collaboration with a friend and old classmate: </p><p class="global-link"><a href="https://niguelchaos.github.io/" target="_blank">Nigel</a></p>

            The game and all systems were coded from scratch without any third-party frameworks, and all art was drawn by ourselves.
            <br><br>It features a 2D-player controller and enemies with AI based on <strong>state machines</strong>, various <strong>player abilities</strong>,
            an <strong>equipment system</strong>, a three-day cycle system based on <strong>custom events</strong>, a <strong>dialogue system</strong>, 
            and <strong>hand-drawn 2D art and animations</strong> and more.
