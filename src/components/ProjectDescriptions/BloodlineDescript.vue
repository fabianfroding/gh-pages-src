            Bloodline is a narrative-driven game made with the <strong>Deig</strong> editor, 
            featuring <strong>four different endings</strong> based on player choices.
            <br><br>
            The game is designed based on the concepts of <strong>skill</strong> and <strong>randomness</strong>.
            The player can make choices that will have both short-term and long-term impacts,
            and must strategize how to use the available choices to reach the good ending.
            <br><br>
            The game takes inspiration from the <strong>Fire Emblem</strong> series and <strong>Tales of Symphonia</strong>, 
            and takes place in a custom-built world and map created with <strong>Inkarnate.com</strong>.
