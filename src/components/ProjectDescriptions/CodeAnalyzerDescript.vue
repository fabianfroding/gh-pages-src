            A tool to analyze and visualize the software architecture in a C# project.
            <br><br>
            The software can visualize and sort C# classes based on lines of code and their number of associations to other classes in the selected project directory.
            <br><br>
            Simply select a directory containing the C# files and the tool will recursively find files in sub-directories as well.
            <br><br>
            The program was developed as a hobby-project with the aim of providing an easy way to get a quick overview of a project's architecture and code complexity.
