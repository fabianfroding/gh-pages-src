            This group project consisted of developing a miniature vehicle to handle a parallel parking-scenario, 
            using <strong>Arduino</strong> and <strong>OpenCV</strong>.
            <br><br>
            The vehicle was built by ourselves from ground-up using parts provided by our client, 
            including sensors to detect obstacles.
            <br><br>
            The behaviour was started from a PC using terminal-commands to command the car remotely.
